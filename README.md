Summary of project: I decided do this project after reading horrible news about baby sitters. I
was thinking how to find baby sitter whom we can trust. So I found a way to do it. The
government have a collection of data about people. Baby sitters will apply to e-government
and we will research the information about him/her. If there is not any bad things we will
accept him/her as baby sitter. So if any family would need a baby sitter, they can login and
search baby sitter from our database who they can trust.
